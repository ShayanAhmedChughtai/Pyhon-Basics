paragraph="I am a very simple boy who stays quiet for most of the time at home,because I do not like talking too much,because i think that when we are talking we sometimes start backbiting about some guy or the one who we hate.I have lived in Saudia Arabi for 9 years.In 2018 we shifted here in karach,then i was in class 4 and now 5 years have passed."
